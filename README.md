# Archived Project
This project was started and completed by Russell Waterhouse in early 2020. 
I undertook this project not with a passion for brain-teaser mobile apps, but with 
a desire to learn Kotlin and the Dagger Dependency Injection Library. 

As such, I am archiving this project. 

It was live on the Google Play store from 2020-2022.
