# ARCHIVED PROJECT: hack_the_code
This project has been archived. It is a small native android application where the user guesses the obfuscated sentence. 
Solutions included [caeser cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), string reversal, vowel-only caeser cipher, word reversal, etc. 
This was live on the app store from 2020-2022, but has since been taken down because I am no longer maintaining it. 

## Why it's archived
Simply put, I'm too busy working on more exciting and interesting projects to continue to maintain this project. 
I've done the responsible thing and taken the unmaintained code down.  I leave it here mostly so that others may use it as a reference, 
as this project does include many aspects that would be useful to developers working on similar projects. Where possible, it used 
best practices as I understood them during development (early 2020). 

I hope someone gets some use out of the example code.
